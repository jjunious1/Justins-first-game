# Justins-first-game

My first game is going to be a game of Blackjack!!

### Description

![BlackJack-Table](https://roarblogs.s3.amazonaws.com/mgm/sports/en/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21111006/Birds-eye-view-of-a-blackjack-table-.jpg 'Text to show on mouseover')

The basic objective of the game is to get the highest total of cards close to 21 without exceeding 21 and to have a higher total than your opponent.
- Player one and 2 are each distributed starting cards. 2 for player 1 and 1 for the opponent.
- Player one can hit up to 3 more times to reach 21. If they exceed it they will immediatley lose. 
- When you are confident with your score you will either stay which will pass turn or keep hitting. 
- The opponent will do the same. 
- To check for the winner you hit Check Score. 
- Reset and start game if you would like to play again.

### How to get Started with existing code!
- Fork and clone this repo. Use `git clone` to place it in a folder you created. 
- `cd` into the folder created by the clone and run `code .`if you would like to modify the existing code.
- The folder has 4 files needed for the game. Two html files, one playgame.js file, one style.css file. 
- The index file is the game homepage the redirects to the playgame.HTML
- The javascript file holds the game information. All of the variables, functions and listeners to get the game to run. 

### How to get Started from scratch
- If you would like to recreate this from scracth you would need to create a couple of files using `touch`. 
- Create two html files, one named index.html, the other you can choose, one css file and one javascript file.  
- From here you want to create your boiler plates for both html pages and [link your CSS and Javascript](https://betterprogramming.pub/link-css-and-js-files-with-html-file-f848d00b42e8#:~:text=To%20link%20a%20CSS%20file,file%20inside%20the%20head%20tag.&text=To%20link%20a%20Js%20file,%3B%20it%20doesn't%20matter.) files in the header. 
- After linking your files you can build out your "landing page" html. 
- You want to be sure to include a button and link to your second html that will hold your game. 
- Next you want to use some basic styling within css on the game and index.html files to have a foundation to build your game. 
-Use the javascript file to first build your variables. 
- Take some time to sudo code or plan out what you need for the game to run. What are some of the winning conditions. What is necessary for it to function.
- After you can start building event listeners and functions that will be necessary for the game. 
- Overall try to have Fun!
