# Justins-first-game

My first game is going to be a game of Blackjack!!

### Description

![BlackJack-Table](https://roarblogs.s3.amazonaws.com/mgm/sports/en/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21111006/Birds-eye-view-of-a-blackjack-table-.jpg 'Text to show on mouseover')

The basic concept should be for 2 players to select cards at random and determine a winner based on set winning of conditions. You can see the winners displayed at the end of the game and continue playing 

### How to get Started with existing code!
- Fork and clone this repo. Use `git clone` to place it in a folder you created. 
- `cd` into the folder created by the clone and run `code .`if you would like to modify the existing code.
- The folder has 4 files needed for the game. Two html files, one playgame.js file, one style.css file. 
- The index file is the game homepage the redirects to the playgame.HTML
- The javascript file holds the game information. All of the variables, functions and listeners to get the game to run. 

### How to get Started from scratch
- If you would like to recreate this from scracth you would need to create a couple of files using `touch`. 
- Create two html files, one named index.html, the other you can choose, one css file and one javascript file.  
- From here you want to create your boiler plates for both html pages and [link your CSS and Javascript](https://betterprogramming.pub/link-css-and-js-files-with-html-file-f848d00b42e8#:~:text=To%20link%20a%20CSS%20file,file%20inside%20the%20head%20tag.&text=To%20link%20a%20Js%20file,%3B%20it%20doesn't%20matter.) files in the header. 
- After linking your files you can build out your "landing page" html that will direct you to your game html file. 
- Next you want to use some basic styling within css on the game and index.html files to have a foundation to build your game. 
-Use the javascript file to build your variables, function and game logic
